# image_processing

A repo to turn raw images (.jpg, any size) into .npy files chunked into 1000 images per file for all images.
The repo also includes basic data augmentation utilities like sampling from rotated images and flipping horizontally.

Read 'pipeline.txt' to see which programs you need to process your own folder of images.
